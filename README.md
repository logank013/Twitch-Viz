# Visualizing Top Twitch Channels

## Data
The data for these visualizations came from sullygnome.com/365. This data is of the top 1000 streamers and top 200 stream categories on Twitch. I also did a case study on the top 50 streamers and their top 50 stream categories respectively.

## Visuals
**Note:** Altair visualizations do not render on GitHub. The two large interactive visualizations use Altair. To see them, download and open the html file in the repository. Alternatively, you could also download and run the notebook file as well.

To look at these visualizations, look at the python notebook file or html download of the notebook. I recommend downloading and opening the html file to see all visuals. This notebook takes a deeper look into the top 1000 streamers and top 200 game categories on the streaming platform, Twitch, as of December 14th, 2022.

The included report explains the visualizations further in depth.
